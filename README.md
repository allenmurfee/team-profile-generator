# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project is a team profile generator that assembles cards on a webpage containing team member info. Each team has a manager, and after that you can add as many engineers and interns as you'd like. The motivation behind this project came from the desire for an easy way to dynamically create a team with contact info, without having to base it on a number of members. This way, it's easy to enter each team member's information without having to build a site.

Throughout this project, I learned a lot about testing using Jest and OOP. After this project, I can see the benefit of OOP and languages built around them, as it's an effective way of accessing data.
